# kanji_flashcard_scraper
Making kanji flashcards with the words on the back of them is very time consuming. I find this especially frustrating when I want make a kanji deck on a particular topic. 
So I'm developing a simple python scraper that takes all the kanji characters from an input.txt file and puts them in flashcard format that can be imported in quizlet.
It will give each kanji character 1-3 word examples sourced from jisho.org. You can use this for example a book you're reading or song lyrics.

Potential plans:

1. Filter kanji by jlpt level
2. Ordering by frequency
